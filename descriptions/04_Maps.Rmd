## Maps in R

**Instructor: Piotr Sobczyk**

Creating spatial data visualization is one of the coolest elements in the R toolbox. 
In the workshop I shall show you tips to follow, pitfalls to avoid and hacks that might be either one of them :) Starting from a basic plot function, we will cover ggplot2 and finish with R packages that use interactive javascript libraries. You will get familiar with the full process from finding the right data, its processing in R up to preparing final data to plot.

I suggest to install the following packages in advance: c('dplyr', 'tidyr', 'sf', 'ggplot2', 'ggmap','ggthemes', 'animation', 'leaflet', 'rnaturalearth').

Shorty a repo with full workshop material will be available.
