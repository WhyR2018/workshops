## Responding to analysis and communication: Data science the R way

**Instructor: Tatjana Kecojevic (DataTeka)**

You have heard about R and would like to learn and see what it does and how it works? Then you should come to our workshop. Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of R and you will get to know how to use its tools needed in a typical data science project. We will introduce you to graphical and numerical techniques for exploring the information concealed within a dataset. After we develop an understanding of our data we will use Râ€™s reproducible and interactive approach in telling our data story by creating reproducible R-Markdown documents and Shiny Web Apps. You should bring a laptop with latest version of R and RStudio installed. All the material will be available for download.
